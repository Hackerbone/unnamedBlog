                <br0>A sunset is my moment just as well as it’s yours. Take a moment to look outside the window, and let the canvas of nature take your breath away. Everyday, the artist Almighty flaunts his brushstrokes to create a beauty that differs from
                    every view. It is what you make of it. My moment, just as well as yours, and yet so different.

                <br> Somewhere amidst the cruel aesthetics of the city, hid an old, dainty bookshop. It revealed itself when I was making my way through a busy road that evening. It had its name scribbled on the outer wall in the vernacular. As I entered
                one of its aisles, I noticed a short, old man. His friendly eyes peered at me, from behind the thick lenses that adorned his wrinkled face. I approached him hesitantly.
                <em>Hours later, I knew I walked out with the finest story the place could offer me.</em>

                <br>As I decided to spend yet another weekend by myself, my empty thoughts were interrupted by the doorbell. It was my kind neighbour, who requested I look after her son for the afternoon. I had never been well acquainted with the ways
                of children, but I knew better than to let him stare at the television for hours.
                <br><br>We set out for a day in the park, which was surprisingly of great amusement to the little boy. He had questions about the smallest of things, be it trees or people or benches. I am a storyteller after all, and the boy lent me an
                ear for all the tales I had to tell.

                <br> I’ve spent the last week in Alicante, a small city tucked away in a corner of wondrous Spain with my better halfone more skill. From the serene beaches to the artistic castles, there is beauty in every corner! I was fortunate to visit
                this time of the year, during the festival of music, dance and theatre. The folks of Alicante live life with passion and make memories every step of the way.
